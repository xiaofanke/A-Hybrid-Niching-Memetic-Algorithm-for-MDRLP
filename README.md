Take instance P8_2 as an example to illustrate the structure of the data.

1) The first line contains the numbers 8 and 2; these correspond to the numbers of facilities and rows, in that order.
2) Subsequently, we express the aisle width between two rows as being 10.
3) The width of each individual facility is specified on the third line.
4) This is followed by the detailing of minimum safety clearances between pairs of facilities and the associated material handling costs.
